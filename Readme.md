# HiRezaGram

HiRezaGram is a Python-based Telegram client that connects to a Telegram server to send and receive messages. This project demonstrates how to build a simple client-server architecture for interacting with Telegram, using Python.

## Features

- **Message Sending/Receiving:** Basic functionality for sending and receiving messages via a Telegram server.
- **Multithreading:** Utilizes Python's threading to handle concurrent operations.
- **Queue Management:** Manages message queues for handling user input and server responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hirezadehghani/HiRezaGram.git
    cd HiRezaGram
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

1. Start the client:

    ```bash
    python client/client_server.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts in the terminal to interact with the Telegram server.

### Project Structure

- `client/`: Contains the main client script for interacting with the Telegram server.
- `server/`: Placeholder for server-side scripts (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Usage

1. **Input Handling:** The client prompts the user for input, which is then processed and sent to the Telegram server.
2. **Message Queue:** Incoming messages from the server are placed in a queue and handled appropriately.

## Example

```bash
$ python client/client_server.py
Enter your message: Hello, Telegram!
Message sent: Hello, Telegram!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Permission Denied**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure that you have the necessary rights to execute the script.
- **TypeError in Queue Handling**: Make sure that the correct Python version is installed and the necessary packages are up to date.

### Debugging

To debug issues, you can run the script with a Python debugger like `pdb`:

```bash
python -m pdb client/client_server.py
```
